## Description
- My old portfolio was very outdated, so I wanted to revamp it with my skills learned in React.
- The updated version is more complex, yet simple, and it is more visually pleasing.
- I learned a lot more about React while working on it, including React Router, sending emails through React, React styling, modals.
